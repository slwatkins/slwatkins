### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am a PhD candidate in the physics department at UC Berkeley. I am a member of the Pyle Group and help our group in the goal to detect dark matter.

Check out our GitHub organization **[@ucbpylegroup](https://github.com/ucbpylegroup)**, where we host some packages on detector R&D, dark matter data analysis, and optimization of code for our detectors. In particular, I am a creator and maintainer of the **[QETpy](https://github.com/ucbpylegroup/QETpy)** and **[RQpy](https://github.com/ucbpylegroup/RQpy)** repositories, so feel free to reach out if there are any questions about them!
