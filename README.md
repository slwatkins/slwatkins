### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am a PhD Candidate in the Physics department at UC Berkeley and a member of the **[Pyle Group](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/pylegroup)** in the pursuit of dark matter detection.

Check out our SPICE/HeRALD Collabration GitHub organization **[@spice-herald](https://github.com/spice-herald)**, where we host some packages on detector R&D, dark matter data analysis, and optimization of code for our detectors. In particular, I am a creator and maintainer of the **[QETpy](https://github.com/spice-herald/QETpy)**, [**`detprocess`**](https://github.com/spice-herald/detprocess), and  [**DarkLim**](https://github.com/spice-herald/DarkLim) repositories, as well as a maintainer of [**`pytesdaq`**](https://github.com/spice-herald/pytesdaq) and [**DarkOpt**](https://github.com/spice-herald/DarkOpt), so feel free to reach out if there are any questions about any of these packages!
