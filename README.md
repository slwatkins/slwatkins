### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I am a member of the LEGEND Collaboration searching for neutrinoless double beta decay and a member of the SPLENDOR Collaboration searching for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors.

I completed my PhD in the Physics department at UC Berkeley as a member of the **[Pyle Group](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/pylegroup)** in the pursuit of dark matter detection. I am still somewhat active in the GitHub repos, so check out the SPICE/HeRALD Collabration GitHub organization **[@spice-herald](https://github.com/spice-herald)**, where we host some packages on detector R&D, dark matter data analysis, and optimization code for our detectors. In particular, I am a creator and maintainer of the **[QETpy](https://github.com/spice-herald/QETpy)**, [**`detprocess`**](https://github.com/spice-herald/detprocess), and  [**DarkLim**](https://github.com/spice-herald/DarkLim) repositories, as well as a maintainer of [**`pytesdaq`**](https://github.com/spice-herald/pytesdaq) and [**DarkOpt**](https://github.com/spice-herald/DarkOpt), so feel free to reach out if there are any questions about any of these packages!
